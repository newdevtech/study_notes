This is a note on forking cloning and pull request tutorial, i would give a brief explanations on what each of these terms mean in a layman unnderstading.

what is forking? A fork is a copy of a repository. Forking a repository allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project.

what is cloning? Cloning a repository pulls down a full copy of all the repository data that GitHub has at that point in time, including all versions of every file and folder for the project. You can push your changes to the remote repository on GitHub, or pull other people's changes from GitHub.

what is pull request? Pull requests let you tell others about changes you've pushed to a branch in a repository on GitHub. Once a pull request is opened, you can discuss and review the potential changes with collaborators and add follow-up commits before your changes are merged into the base branch.

Thank you for your time in reading this brief explanations.
